# Third-party attributions

The OpsContext Browser Capture extension uses selector seeds adapted from the
following MIT-licensed prior-art Chrome extensions. We use **only the selector
constants** (the strings identifying DOM elements on claude.ai and chatgpt.com).
The capture architecture (streaming events vs one-shot file export), audit-chain
integration, policy-driven redaction, and local HTTP transport are entirely
original to OpsContext.

DOM selectors themselves are facts about the underlying page structure and are
not copyrightable, but the explicit lists of selectors below represent
substantial effort by the original authors. We acknowledge them here.
