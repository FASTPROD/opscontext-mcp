/**
 * 🔒 LOCKED [UNKNOWN-COMMAND-MUST-NOT-START-A-SERVER] — 2026-08-20
 * ⛔ NEVER route an unrecognised argv[2] to the MCP server again. The MCP server starts
 *    ONLY on a bare invocation, or on the explicit `serve` alias.
 * WHY: `cli.ts` dispatched with a long if/else chain ending in `else { import("./index.js") }`,
 *      so ANY unknown token started a stdio server that silently waits on stdin. A typo
 *      (`contextengine scor`), a flag-first invocation (`contextengine --version`) or a
 *      renamed subcommand produced no error, no exit code, and no output — it hung.
 *      This is [ABSENCE-IS-NOT-A-VERDICT] at the dispatch layer: "I do not recognise this"
 *      was rendered as "start the default mode", a plausible action chosen from a branch
 *      that had determined nothing. It has already cost a wrong finding: SESSION_22 §E3
 *      recorded "check_ports is ungated on the CLI" when there is no `check-ports` command
 *      at all — what got measured was an MCP server booting.
 * FIX: KNOWN_COMMANDS below is the single source of truth. Unknown token → name it on
 *      stderr, suggest the nearest command, exit 1. A parity test asserts this list matches
 *      the literals the dispatcher actually handles, so the two cannot drift.
