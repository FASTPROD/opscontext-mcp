 * WHY: `contextengine score /Users/yan/Projects/PLANK.io` failed with
 *      "Project not found: /Users/yan/Projects/PLANK.io" while listing PLANK.io
 *      among the available projects. A path is the natural first guess for a
 *      tool that prints absolute paths in its own output, and the error named
 *      the one thing the user had clearly just given it. The directory was
 *      never inspected — the lookup only ever compared basenames, so this was
 *      [ABSENCE-IS-NOT-A-VERDICT] at the argument-parsing layer: "not in my
 *      name index" was reported as "does not exist".
 * FIX: resolve names AND paths. A path that exists AND carries a project marker is a
 *      project, whether or not it sits under a configured workspace — that is what makes
 *      the tool usable outside `~/Projects`.
 *
 * 🔒 LOCKED [RESOLVE-PATH-MUST-BE-A-PROJECT] — 2026-08-16
 * ⛔ NEVER accept "it is a directory that exists" as proof that a path is a project, and
 *    NEVER let a bare name that missed the index fall through to path resolution.
 * WHY: the first cut did both, and an adversarial review reproduced three consequences.
 *      1. `cd ~/Projects && score .` wrote `~/Projects/SCORE.md` — "Projects: 27/100 (F),
 *         Not a git repo" — into the CONTAINER of 37 repositories. The identical command
 *         WITHOUT the `.` was correctly refused, so the guard existed and one entry point
 *         walked straight past it. Same for `score ~/Projects`, `score ..`, and `score /`.
 *      2. `score src`, `score dist`, `score docs` — a typo or a half-remembered name — no
 *         longer errored with "Available: …". The bare token fell through to
 *         `resolve(token)` against the cwd, so it silently scored a SUBDIRECTORY and wrote
 *         a SCORE.md into it. In this repo `score dist` writes `dist/SCORE.md`, which then
 *         ships inside the npm tarball.
 *      3. It made the sibling LOCK a half-truth: [SCORE-CWD-MUST-BE-A-PROJECT] promises a
 *         non-project is never scored, but enforced it on the no-argument path only.
 * FIX: a directory must carry a build/VCS marker to be scoreable, and a bare name resolves
 *      against the fleet index ONLY. Configured projects always pass — they are the fleet
 *      by definition. Absence of a marker is a measurement, not permission to write.

 * 🔒 LOCKED [SCORE-CWD-MUST-BE-A-PROJECT] — 2026-08-16
 * ⛔ NEVER fall back to returning `start` when no project marker is found. A directory

 * WHY: the first cut of this returned `start` on failure, reasoning that "an un-versioned
 *      directory is still scoreable — it just scores badly." That is exactly the
 *      absence-as-verdict mistake this codebase keeps relearning. Running `score` from
 *      `~/Projects` — a CONTAINER of 37 projects, not a project — walked to the filesystem
 *      root, found nothing, fell back, scored the container as though it were a project,
 *      and wrote `~/Projects/SCORE.md` claiming "Projects: 27/100 (F)". Run from `/` it
 *      would do the same to the filesystem root. "I cannot tell which project you mean" is
 *      an unknown, and the safe response to an unknown scope is to ask, never to write.
 * FIX: return null and let the caller error out with the three things the user can do

 * ⛔ NEVER return the nearest `package.json` directory without first checking whether a

 *      **"Scoring current project: server ... 32% (F) — Not a git repo, No CI pipeline,
 *      README.md Missing"** and wrote `server/SCORE.md`. Every one of those statements is
 *      false about the project the user is standing in: the repo root has `.git`, CI, and
 *      a README. A build file marks a *package*; `.git` marks the *project*. Reporting
 *      "Not a git repo" from inside a git repo is the scorer describing a boundary it
 *      invented — absence-as-verdict again, this time about where the project ends.
 * FIX: `.git` wins. Walk up looking for it, remembering the nearest build file on the way,
 *      and fall back to that remembered directory only if no `.git` exists anywhere above.
 *      A genuinely standalone package (no git anywhere) still resolves to itself.
