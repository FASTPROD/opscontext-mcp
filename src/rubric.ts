/**
 * Scoring thresholds — the numbers that decide what earns what.
 *
 * 🔒 LOCKED [RUBRIC-SINGLE-TABLE] — 2026-08-14
 * ⛔ NEVER inline a scoring threshold back into src/agents.ts.
 * WHY: these values are what makes a score gameable — knowing ">50 lines earns the full 10"
 *      lets anyone pad a file to a number instead of writing the content. They were scattered
 *      as bare literals across ~10 call sites in agents.ts, so they shipped readable in
 *      dist/agents.js and could not be obscured without rewriting the whole scorer.
 * FIX: one table, one module. `scripts/obfuscate-rubric.mjs` rewrites dist/rubric.js at build
 *      time into an encoded blob, so the published package carries no readable thresholds.
 *      Adding a literal back into agents.ts silently re-exposes it — the obfuscator only
 *      touches this file.
 *
 * NOTE ON STRENGTH: this stops casual reading, not determined analysis. The surrounding
 * comparison logic still ships, and 2.1.3 remains on npm forever as a plaintext reference.
 * It is a speed bump for score-gaming, deliberately, and must never be described as more.
 * The real protections are the activation gate and BSL-1.1. See CLAUDE.md rules 1-3.
