/**
 * Tools Manifest — single source of truth for the MCP tool catalog.
 *
 * Why: the info panel in the VS Code extension (and the README) historically
 * hardcoded the tool count ("Active on all 17 MCP tools"). When new tools
 * shipped (drift_status was the 21st), those displays silently drifted.
 *
 * Fix: every tool exposed via `server.tool(...)` in `index.ts` MUST appear
 * in `ALL_TOOLS` below. A regression test in `tests/tools-manifest.test.ts`
 * counts `^server.tool(` lines in `index.ts` and asserts the count matches
 * `ALL_TOOLS.length`. If you add or remove a tool, this list + the test
 * fail together — no silent drift possible.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - `index.ts` writes `~/.contextengine/server-meta.json` on startup with
 *     `{ toolCount, premiumCount, freeCount, version, generatedAt }` so the
 *     VS Code extension can read it without needing an active MCP session.
 *   - `activation.ts` imports `PREMIUM_TOOL_NAMES` (the subset that requires
 *     a PRO license).
 *
 * @module tools-manifest
